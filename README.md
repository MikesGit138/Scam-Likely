# Scam-Likely
Assignment3 - Project for COMP3220

# Description
This python program is a scam message detection system that uses machine learning to classify messages as either scam or legitimate. The system processes text messages, extracts various features from them, and uses a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict whether a message is a scam or legitimate. Additionally, the program evaluates the legitimacy of the sender's email address based on known legitimate domains.
